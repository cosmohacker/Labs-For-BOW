You need to use this extension in VSCode. If you don't, the project may not work properly. Also, don't forget to start at "master.html".

ActiveX is a technology developed by Microsoft, which allows software components to be reused across different applications. It is primarily designed for use in Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser. ActiveX uses Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) technology, which is tightly integrated with the Windows operating system.

However, other browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, do not support ActiveX due to security concerns, as it can potentially allow malicious code to be executed on a user's computer. Additionally, ActiveX is a proprietary technology that is not supported by other operating systems such as macOS and Linux. Therefore, other browsers have developed alternative technologies, such as NPAPI and PPAPI, to enable browser extensions and plugins to be developed and used on their platforms.

Anyway, if you're reviewing this project on Chrome or any other browser, the last lab work (Lab 12) will not work because of the ActiveXObject Database Extension. The reason why it won't work is that the other browsers don't support ActiveX. It only works on Internet Explorer.
